iBranch
➢ Branches are used to create another line of development.
➢ By default, Git has a master branch, which is same as trunk in Subversion (SVN). Usually, a
branch is created to work on a new feature.
➢ Once the feature is completed, it is merged back with the master branch and we delete the branch.
Tags
➢ Tags similar to branches, but the difference is that tags are immutable.
➢ It means, tag is a branch, which nobody intends to modify. Once a tag is created for a particular
commit, even if you create a new commit, it will not be updated.
➢ Usually, developers create tags for product releases.
#git branch : It gives the branch names in current repository.
